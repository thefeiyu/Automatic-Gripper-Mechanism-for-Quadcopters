# Automatic-Gripper-Mechanism-for-Quadcopters
Designed and built a gripping mechanism, using 3D printing, that allows flying robots to perch onto a roof or the wall. The mechanism is completely passive, meaning that there are no electronics used for the drone to perch. The attachment and detachment are facilitated by a bistable mechanism (a mechanism with two stable equilibrium positions within their range of motion). With a custom designed and fabricated suction cup that is able to resist a force more than 10 N. This allows a drone or other flying robots to attach onto smooth surfaces such as vertical walls and windows, roofs, and moving vehicles. For this project, I was the second author of the research paper that was submitted for the 2022 ICRA, IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation.
